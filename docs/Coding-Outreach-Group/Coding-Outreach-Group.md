# Coding Outreach Group

The Coding Outreach Group was founded at Temple University by [Haroon Popal](https://sites.temple.edu/cnltu/haroon-popal/) and [Elizabeth Beard](https://www.fox.temple.edu/about-fox/directory/liz-beard/)

Our aim is to help people learn more about coding, whether this is from a beginner role or intermediate role.

Much of our expertise lie in coding surrounding Python and Neuroimaging, but we are expanding!
