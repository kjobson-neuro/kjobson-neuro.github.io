## Welcome to my page!

My name is Katie Jobson and I am currently a PhD student under [Dr. Ingrid Olson's](https://sites.temple.edu/cnltu/ingrid-olson-phd/) supervision. I am studying the role of the cerebellum in non-motor function. I like to code in Python, Bash, FSL, and GitHub!

I am in the department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University. I have a strong background in coding and have been striving to be more open source in my documentation. I am currently living in Philadelphia, PA, USA. My favorite things to do are to travel, hike and try good food around the city!
