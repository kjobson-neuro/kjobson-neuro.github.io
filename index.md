# Welcome to my page!

My name is Katie Jobson and I am currently a PhD student under [Dr. Ingrid Olson's](https://sites.temple.edu/cnltu/ingrid-olson-phd/) supervision. I am studying the role of the cerebellum in non-motor function. I like to code in Python, Bash, FSL, and GitHub!

I am currently living in Philadelphia, PA, USA. My favorite things to do are to travel, hike and try good food around the city!

## What is this page for?

This website contains information about me, my publications and current projects, as well as workshops I have hosted!

The creation of this website was actually for a workshop demonstration, but I had so much fun with it that I kept it as my actual page.
